# myFNCS

This will install and run everything needed for FNCS (FNCS, GridLab-D, ns-3.26, zeromq, libczmq-dev (ubuntu), xterm, autoconf, libxerces, libtool).
It starts the FNCS tutorial (https://github.com/FNCS/FNCS-Tutorial/tree/master/demo-gld-ns3) if everything went all right.

It uses files that were downloaded on January 27th, 2020 (I don't think the developers are maintaining FNCS nowadays).
